## 1. A narrowly defined topic will guide your research better than a broad topic.

"A topic is an approach to a subject, one that asks a *question* whose answer solves a *problem*  that your readers care about." (Booth et al., 2014)

General topic: "How has Islamic thought developed in the modern period?"

Narrow topic: "How did the popular uprisings in Egypt during the 2010s affect Islamic political philosophy?"

### Use reference sources to narrow your topic.
* [Oxford Bibliographies Online](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=OBO)
* [Oxford Islamic Studies Online](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=RsrcRcrdOxfordIslmStds)


## 2. There is no perfect database or catalog

### Consider:
* Do you need primary or secondary sources?
* What kind of primary sources do you need?
* Do you need peer-reviewed sources?
* Do you need full text or just bibliographic information?
* Are you looking for a disciplinary perspective?

### Subject specific databases
* [Index Islamicus](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=PQIndIsl)
* [ATLA Religion](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=ATLAReligion)

### Disciplinary Databases
* [Historical Abstracts](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=HistAbs)
* [America: History & Life](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=AmerHistLife)
* [Sociological Abstracts](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=PQSociolgcAbs)

### A note on Google
* Google does not contain all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous searches.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.


## 3. Not all sources are created equal

What makes a source useful?

### Relevance
* If it's a book, look through the index for your key terms.
* If it's an article, read the abstract for the main points.
* Skim the introduction to get a sense of the source.
* Check the bibliography to see what other authors this author is in conversation with.

### Reliability
* Is it published by a reputable publisher?
* Is the author an expert in the field?
* Has the source been peer-reviewed?
* Does the source have sufficient notes and a bibliography?
* Has the source been well-received? (Book reviews and citations)


## 4. Read sources efficiently

### Reading books efficiently
1. Examine the table of contents to understand the structure of the book.
2. Skim the introduction and conclusion.
3. Look through the index to find passages of interest to you, then read those passages or chapters.
4. Read book reviews on the book.

### Reading articles efficiently
1. Read through the abstract.
2. Skim the introduction and conclusion.
3. Use section headings to find the most relevant sections for you.


## 5. Use sources convincingly

Different kinds of sources will serve different purposes in your research.

### BEAM method (Bizup, 2015)
* Background
* Exhibit
* Argument
* Method

* **Background** - some sources will provide you a conceptual background and context for your topic.

* **Exhibit** - some sources will be the main focus of your analysis.

* **Argument** - some sources will be your conversation partners, you can argue against them or use them to further your own argument.

* **Method** - some sources will provide examples of methodology or ways of analyzing an issue that you can apply to your topic.


## 6. Maintain a research log

A research log is an informal way of documenting your research progress. It is an effective way to keep track of your databases searches as well as your notes on sources. Research logs are useful because they track your progress, store your notes, and encourage you to be reflective on your research and reading.

Research logs may take many formats, but a successful research log will contain three related parts:
* A record of database searches
* Source notes
* An annotated bibliography
